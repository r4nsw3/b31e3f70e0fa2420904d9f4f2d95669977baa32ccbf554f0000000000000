  |   Explore incredible places far from the Mushroom Kingdom as you join   |
  |   Mario and his new ally Cappy on a massive, globe-trotting 3D          |
  |   adventure.                                                            |

  |   Use amazing new abilities - like the power to capture and control     |
  |   objects, animals, and enemies - to collect Power Moons so you can     |
  |   power up the Odyssey airship and save Princess Peach from Bowser's    |
  |   wedding plans!                                                        |

  |   Thanks to heroic, hat-shaped Cappy, Mario's got new moves that'll     |
  |   make you rethink his traditional run-and-jump gameplay - like cap     |
  |   jump, cap throw, and capture. Use captured cohorts such as enemies,   |
  |   objects, and animals to progress through the game and uncover loads   |
  |   of hidden collectibles. And if you feel like playing with a friend,   |
  |   just pass them a Joy-Con controller! Player 1 controls Mario while    |
  |   Player 2 controls Cappy. This sandbox-style 3D Mario adventure -      |
  |   the first since 1996's beloved Super Mario 64 and 2002's Nintendo     |
  |   GameCube classic Super Mario Sunshine - is packed with secrets and    |
  |   surprises, plus exciting new kingdoms to explore.                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Explore astonishing new locales like skyscraper-packed New Donk     |
  |     City to your heart's content, and run into familiar friends and     |
  |     foes as you try to save Princess Peach from Bowser's dastardly      |
  |     wedding plans                                                       |
